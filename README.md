"Food Recipe App" utilizes React and Edamam API to search for recipes based on user input. Users can explore a variety of recipes, filtering by ingredients, calories, and health preferences. The app provides a user-friendly interface for discovering diverse culinary options.

1. **Imports**: The code imports `React` and `useState` from the React library, as well as a component named `Products` from './Products'.

2. **Functional Component**: `App` is a functional component defined using arrow function syntax.

3. **State Declaration**: Two state variables, `search` and `data`, are declared using the `useState` hook. `search` holds the value of the user's search query, and `data` holds the fetched recipe data.

4. **API Credentials**: The API credentials (`YOUR_APP_ID` and `YOUR_APP_KEY`) for the Edamam API are declared. These will be used to authenticate requests to the API.

5. **Submit Handler**: The `submitHandler` function is defined to handle form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior, constructs the API URL with the search query and API credentials, and fetches data from the Edamam API using `fetch`. Once the data is retrieved, it is converted to JSON format and stored in the `data` state variable.

6. **Return JSX**: The `App` component returns JSX, which represents the UI of the application. It consists of a form with an input field for the user to enter their search query. On submission, the `submitHandler` function is called. If `data` contains more than one item, the `Products` component is rendered with the fetched data; otherwise, it renders `null`.

7. **Export**: Finally, the `App` component is exported as the default export of the module.
